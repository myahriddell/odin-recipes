# odin-recipes

This project is to create a recipe website. Initially, I'll just be using HTML to create a rudimentary webpage, but later, I will expand upon this project using CSS. 

So far in the Odin Project - Foundations, I've learned how to write the boilerplate, work with lists, links, images, as well as text tags.
